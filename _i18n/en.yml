about:
  paragraph_1: "Masari (MSR) is a proof of work (PoW) peer-to-peer internet currency using the well researched and cryptographically sound <a href='https://lab.getmonero.org/pubs/MRL-0005.pdf' target='_blank'>RingCT</a> and <a href='https://cryptonote.org/whitepaper.pdf' target='_blank'>CryptoNote</a> protocols. This means that every transaction origin, amount, and destination is obfuscated by default. Masari is an open source project that is fully decentralized without any central authorities, similar to bitcoin. With several CryptoNote firsts such as uncle mining via the <a href='https://github.com/masari-project/research-corner/blob/master/secor/secor.pdf' target='_blank'>SECOR protocol</a>, a <a href='https://wallet.getmasari.org' target='_blank'>fully client side web wallet</a>, and PoW sharding via the <a href='https://github.com/masari-project/research-corner/blob/master/blocktree/blocktree.pdf' target='_blank'>blocktree protocol</a>, Masari is a fast, fungible, secure, private and soon-to-be efficiently scalable currency."
  paragraph_2: "With ring signatures, ring confidential transactions, and stealth addresses, every transaction origin, amount, and destination is untraceable and unlinkable. Transactions on the Masari blockchain cannot be linked to a particular user or real-world identity."
  paragraph_3: "Private by default, Masari is a fungible form of currency.  Vendors and exchanges are unable to blacklist units of Masari from previous transaction associations."
  paragraph_4: "Uncle mining (SECOR protocol) securely reduces block time to 60 seconds, unlike the common 120 seconds present in most CryptoNote coins. Combined with low fees, your funds will be sent and received quickly and at a fraction of the cost."
  paragraph_5: "Masari created the first iteration of what is now the LWMA difficulty algorithm. Masari uses an improved LWMA as our difficulty algorithm to address the issue of flash mining and slow difficulty adjustments in order to keep mining profitable and our network secure."
  paragraph_6: "In addition to reducing block time, our SECOR protocol also helps to add more 'weight' to the blockchain by rewarding miners who solve <a href='https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/orphan-block-cryptocurrency.asp' target='_blank'>orphan blocks</a>, further securing the network and providing additional protection against chainsplits."
  paragraph_7: "Our <a href='https://github.com/masari-project/masari-webwallet' target='_blank'>web wallet</a> is also fully client side, meaning you can safely and effectively spend your money anywhere and anytime."
  paragraph_8: "Currently, CryptoNote coins are unable to scale efficiently due to the inherent default privacy features taking up a big portion of every transaction’s size. Masari’s solution to this problem is blocktree, a method which increases transaction throughput by allowing multiple blocks to be mined in parallel. Utilizing this protocol, the network will be able to retain efficiency under heavier loads as Masari is further supported and used. Blocktree is currently in the works."

  intro: "Masari is a fork of the Monero project, and has incorporated improvements from the Monero code base along the way.  Since Monero itself is often heralded as the leading privacy coin, it is worth asking what makes Masari unique from Monero. Here are some points of difference, broken out in the areas of Technology, Privacy, Usability and Community."
  tech:
    paragraph_1: "Masari's underlying technology has a few differences from Monero. Masari still uses the CryptoNight Proof-of-work (PoW) algorithm, while Monero has moved to the RandomX PoW."
    paragraph_2: "For a small project with a small development team, Masari has shown the ability to innovate and improve its technology over the Monero code base. Masari implemented an improved difficulty adjustment algorithm which allows the blockchain to maintain a steady block creation time, even during traffic volume spikes. This early work has become the LWMA difficulty algorithm and has been incorporated by other coins."
    paragraph_3: "The Masari project has also achieved a shorter block creation time of 60 seconds which is half that of Monero and most other CryptoNote / Monero-based projects. This is accomplished by using the Simple Extended Consensus Resolution (SECOR) protocol.  This unique protocol maintains security and protection against chainsplits even with the faster block emissions, allowing Masari to maintain lower transaction times and costs as the coin scales to wider use.  SECOR uses a concept known as 'uncle mining' which validates and reduces the number of 'orphan' blocks on the chain. With SECOR enabled, Masari could lower the block time to roughly 15 seconds and still maintain a healthy network."
    paragraph_4: "Finally, the lead developer has proposed a tree-partitioned structure, called Blocktree.  This modified structure would allow multiple blocks to be mined in parallel.  The result would maintain the secure concepts of a decentralized consensus blockchain while greatly increasing transaction throughput.  Currently, Masari does not have the transaction volume to require Blocktree, but the basic design has been documented for developers to work on.  If you are a C++ developer looking for a challenge, you may be able to help with this!"
    paragraph_5: "On the flipside, Monero has improved their technology in a few ways that have not been incorporated by the Masari project.  This includes enhancements to prevent privacy attacks during transaction propagation (the Dandelion++ protocol), and to reduce transaction size and verification times (CLSAG signature).  These enhancements will be considered by the Masari team for future release."
  priv:
    paragraph_1: "Masari is a slightly more private blockchain than Monero, since it has employed Ring Confidential Transactions (Ring CT) from the beginning. Ring CT is a method that not only obscures the sending address of a transaction, but also the amount of the transaction.  The Monero blockchain's early years of transactions allow the exact transaction amounts to be seen, and it has been shown that a blockchain analyzer can accurately trace coins to specific early transactions and possible wallet addresses."
  use: 
    paragraph_1: "Masari has a great client-side wallet available as a Web wallet, as well as mobile and desktop versions.  Most Masari users feel that this wallet is more user friendly than Monero's native wallet options for a client-side wallet (keeping your wallet transactions local to your own device). The Masari team plans to look at ways to make the coin more user-friendly and accessible to non-technical users.  If you have skills in mobile or Web development technologies, you may be able to help with these goals!"
  community:
    paragraph_1: "Like Monero, Masari has a solid community infrastructure set up for the project which allows communication and collaboration between community members.  Unlike Monero, the Masari community is small.  There are some negatives and positives to this."
    paragraph_2: "Since Masari has a small developer team, it lags behind Monero when deciding to implement any desirable improvements that Monero has added. As a result of being a small project, there are fewer exchanges and 3rd party wallets which support Masari."
    paragraph_3: "On the positive side, having a small community around an innovative product makes it possible to jump in and make an impact in a short time frame.  Anyone with an interest in using and growing their skills as a developer, content creator, marketer, etc. can quickly find a place to pitch in and gain experience with the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency!"
